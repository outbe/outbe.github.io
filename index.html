                    <h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-4xl font-light leading-none mb-12">Gratis to the Consumer:<br>Reframing Capital Gain as <br>Recognition of the <br>Act of Consumption</h1>
                    <div class="text-base sm:text-base leading-relaxed font-inter font-light">    
                        <p>v1 04.30.25</p>
                        <p>In conventional economic theory, capital gain is defined as the return on ownership, investment, or strategic positioning. The investor is the subject of accumulation; the consumer is treated as an external function, necessary but excluded. Within this logic, consumption is the endpoint of value circulation, not its origin.</p>                    
                        <p>outbe proposes a structural inversion. Capital gain is not simply a return to investors extracted from consumer behavior, but a symbolic and monetary return to the consumer, recognizing their generative role in the system. <strong>Gratis</strong> is the name for that return.</p>                    
                        <p>In this system, consumption is not merely the use or payment for goods and services; it is a performative act that inscribes the subject into a symbolic and economic order. To consume is to participate in the creation and distribution of value, not only financially, but symbolically, socially, and structurally. The consumer not only absorbs value, but they also activate and legitimize it.</p>
                        <p>Capital gain, then, must be reframed. It is not a surplus for the asset-holder; it is a return from the system to the one whose Acts of Consumption enabled the very existence of that value. The consumer is not peripheral — they are the condition that makes value creation possible.</p>                    
                        <p>Gratis, in this sense, is not metaphorical; it is monetary. Yet it is not limited to direct financial return. It also manifests as visibility, access, influence, trust, and symbolic capital. These forms do not dilute the economic core of Gratis; they extend it across multiple registers of value. What matters is the system's ability to recognize and reciprocate the consumer's generative act.</p>                    
                        <p>This transformation is already underway. The dynamics of platform economies, decentralized networks, and user-data monetization all point to the shifting role of the consumer, from endpoint to creator. The rise of user dividends, blockchain-based incentive structures, and attention economies further underscores this trend.</p>                    
                        <p>To frame capital gain as Gratis is to redefine the subject of economic value. It is not only the owner, but the performer. In a symbolic economy, every Act of Consumption is an event, and it calls for recognition.</p>
                    
                        <h2>The Architecture of outbe</h2>
                        <p>outbe is a decentralized blockchain network built around this new logic of value. It has no central organization, no corporate governance: it is purely protocol-driven.</p>
                        <p>The network introduces a capped emission mechanism for its native coin — coen, strictly tied to the network's growth. Allocations occur only when the coen's market price rises, ensuring that value creation aligns with real network expansion. No coens allocations occur during “red days,” when the price declines. New coens are allocated only during “green days,” when the price rises, confirming organic netowk growth.</p>
                        <p>Validators, Network Registry Agents (NRA), Consumption Reflection Agents (CRA), and Regulated Financial Agents (RFA) are the network's primary operational agents:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc">
                            <li><strong>Validators</strong> secure the network under a new Proof of Consumption consensus algorithm focused not only on transaction finality but also on network safety and integrity.</li>
                            <li><strong>NRAs</strong> maintain the Network Registries.</li>
                            <li><strong>CRAs</strong> verify authentic Acts of Consumption that qualify for recognition.</li>
                            <li><strong>RFAs</strong> oversee regulatory compliance and maintain the bridge between outbe and external financial systems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Validators and CRAs receive fees for their services, regardless of green or red days, ensuring the system's operational stability. Mining rights are granted to users. Only verified Acts of Consumption, proven by CRAs and validated according to the network's protocol rules, participate in allocations of coens during green days. Thus, consumers who contribute to network growth participate in coens allocation.</p>
                        <p>While outbe remains decentralized, designated regulated agents (CRAs and RFAs) maintain compliance oversight, allowing the network to meet necessary regulatory standards without centralizing user data. The network itself does not know users' identities; only regulated agents involved in the verification processes hold this information.</p>
                        <p>By reflecting verified Acts of Consumption into the network as Tribute – non transferrable NFT, an eligible interest in Gratis (non transferrable fungible token that grants the right to mine coens at a 1:1 ratio at the user’s discretion) allocation is established. On green days, a predefined amount of coens becomes available for allocation. An algorithm with randomised resolution determines which Tributes receive recognition and under what conditions, all within the limits of the available allocation.</p>
                        <p>When coen price increases by the rate defined for each Tribute, the account associated with that Tribute mines Gratis. This system architecture distinguishes participation (Tribute) and gratitude (Gratis), ensuring recognition is directly tied to actual network growth.</p>
                        <p>outbe is an economic system: one where participation, not possession, is the condition of value creation and distribution.</p>
