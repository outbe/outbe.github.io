                    <h1 class="text-4xl sm:text-4xl font-light leading-none mb-12">Gratis to the Consumer:<br>Reframing Capital Gain as <br>Recognition of the <br>Act of Consumption</h1>
                    <div class="text-base sm:text-base leading-relaxed font-inter font-light">    
                        <p>v1 04.30.25</p>
                        <p>In conventional economic theory, capital gain is defined as the return on ownership, investment, or strategic positioning. The investor is the subject of accumulation; the consumer is treated as an external function, necessary but excluded. Within this logic, consumption is the endpoint of value circulation, not its origin.</p>                    
                        <p>outbe proposes a structural inversion. Capital gain is not simply a return to investors extracted from consumer behavior, but a symbolic and monetary return to the consumer, recognizing their generative role in the system. <strong>Gratis</strong> is the name for that return.</p>                    
                        <p>In this system, consumption is not merely the use or payment for goods and services; it is a performative act that inscribes the subject into a symbolic and economic order. To consume is to participate in the creation and distribution of value, not only financially, but symbolically, socially, and structurally. The consumer not only absorbs value, but they also activate and legitimize it.</p>
                        <p>Capital gain, then, must be reframed. It is not a surplus for the asset-holder; it is a return from the system to the one whose Acts of Consumption enabled the very existence of that value. The consumer is not peripheral — they are the condition that makes value creation possible.</p>                    
                        <p>Gratis, in this sense, is not metaphorical; it is monetary. Yet it is not limited to direct financial return. It also manifests as visibility, access, influence, trust, and symbolic capital. These forms do not dilute the economic core of Gratis; they extend it across multiple registers of value. What matters is the system's ability to recognize and reciprocate the consumer's generative act.</p>                    
                        <p>This transformation is already underway. The dynamics of platform economies, decentralized networks, and user-data monetization all point to the shifting role of the consumer, from endpoint to creator. The rise of user dividends, blockchain-based incentive structures, and attention economies further underscores this trend.</p>                    
                        <p>To frame capital gain as Gratis is to redefine the subject of economic value. It is not only the owner, but the performer. In a symbolic economy, every Act of Consumption is an event, and it calls for recognition.</p>
                    
                        <h2>The Architecture of outbe</h2>
                        <p>outbe is a decentralized blockchain network built around this new logic of value. It has no central organization, no corporate governance: it is purely protocol-driven.</p>
                        <p>The network introduces a capped emission mechanism for its native coin - coen, strictly tied to the network's growth. Allocations occur only when the coen's market price rises, ensuring that value creation aligns with real network expansion. No coen allocations occur during “red days,” when the price declines. New coen are allocated only during “green days,” when the price rises, confirming organic network growth.</p>
                        <p>Validators, Consumption Reflection Agents (CRA), Wallet Apps and Regulated Financial Agents (RFA) are the network's primary operational agents:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc">
                            <li><strong>Validators</strong> propose, verify, and finalize blocks, securing the network using Proof of Stake consensus.</li>
                            <li><strong>CRAs</strong> process and verify users' spending transactions that qualifies for recognition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wallet Apps</strong> create and maintain user interfaces to network functionality.</li>
                            <li><strong>RFAs</strong> oversee regulatory compliance and maintain the bridge between outbe and external financial systems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Validators, CRAs and Wallet Apps receive fees for their services, regardless of green or red days, ensuring the system's operational stability. Mining rights are granted to users. Only verified spending transactions, processed by CRAs and validated according to the network's rules, participates in the allocation of Gratis during green days. Thus, consumers who contribute to network growth participate in Gratis allocation.</p>
                        <p>While outbe remains decentralized, designated regulated agents (CRAs and RFAs) maintain compliance oversight, allowing the network to meet necessary regulatory standards without centralizing user data. The network itself does not know users' identities; only regulated agents involved in the verification processes hold this information.</p>
                        <p>By reflecting verified spending transactions into the network, an eligible interest in Gratis (a non-transferable fungible token that is the right to mine coens at a 1:1 ratio at the user’s discretion) is established. Transactions are first verified off-chain by CRAs and reduced to privacy-preserving fingerprints, which are then aggregated into a single on-chain Tribute (a non-transferable NFT). On green days, a predefined amount of Gratis becomes available for allocation. Lysis (the network algorithm) determines the fraction applied to each Tribute and the conditions under which Gratis is allocated, within the limits of the available emission. The network responds by issuing Nods (non-transferable NFTs) that carry the allocated Gratis and its conditions.</p>
                        <p>When the coen price increases by the rate defined for each Nod, the account associated with that Nod can mine Gratis. This system architecture distinguishes participation (Tribute) and gratitude (Gratis), ensuring recognition is directly tied to actual network growth.</p>
                        <p>outbe is an economic system: one where participation, not possession, is the condition of value creation and distribution.</p>
